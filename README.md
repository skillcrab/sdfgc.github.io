THIS WEBSITE IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AT THIS TIME

# San Diego FGC Website

This is a fork of the [Ohio FGC](https://ohiofgc.com) website as originally written by [corjam](https://twitter.com/codecory) and hosted at [https://github.com/OhioFGC/OhioFGC.github.io](https://github.com/OhioFGC/OhioFGC.github.io). I've created this website because too many new players have trouble finding information on the scene. It also doesn't help that more people are opting to skip social media and most of this info is scattered across too many ~~Twitter~~X accounts, Facebook pages, and Discord servers to count. This website is a stab at trying to fix the problem by consolidating all of the information on where to find events for the San Diego Fighting Gamne Community into one easy-to-find website that can be found over Google.

Quoting [corjam](https://twitter.com/codecory):

> The Ohio Fighting Game Community is pretty large and separated.  The amount of times I run into new players and they say they couldn't find any information about the scene is way more than it should be.  So this website is an attempt to help consolidate information to make it easier for people to find the events and players near them.
